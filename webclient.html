<!--Client Server Model-->
<h2 style="font-size:30px ; text-align: center;" >

    <strong><u>Client-Server Model</u><br></strong>
</h2><p>
The client-server model, or client-server architecture, is a distributed application framework dividing tasks between servers and clients, which either reside in the same system or communicate through a computer network or the Internet. The client relies on sending a request to another program in order to access a service made available by a server. The server runs one or more programs that share resources with and distribute work among clients.<br></div>
The client server relationship communicates in a request–response messaging pattern and must adhere to a common communications protocol, which formally defines the rules, language, and dialog patterns to be used. Client-server communication typically adheres to the TCP/IP protocol suite.<br>
TCP protocol maintains a connection until the client and server have completed the message exchange. TCP protocol determines the best way to distribute application data into packets that networks can deliver, transfers packets to and receives packets from the network, and manages flow control and retransmission of dropped or garbled packets. IP is a connectionless protocol in which each packet traveling through the Internet is an independent unit of data unrelated to any other data units.<br>
Client requests are organized and prioritized in a scheduling system, which helps servers cope in the instance of receiving requests from many distinct clients in a short space of time. The client-server approach enables any general-purpose computer to expand its capabilities by utilizing the shared resources of other hosts. Popular client-server applications include email, the World Wide Web, and network printing.<br><br>

<!--Web Based apps-->
<h2 style="font-size:30px ; text-align: center;" >
    <div id="webapp">
    <strong><u>Components of web-based applications</u><br></strong>
</h2>

<p>
<strong>Domain Name System</strong><br>
Domain Name System (DNS) bridges the communication gap between computers and humans and makes the machine-user interaction a lot easier. It’s a fundamental system that resolves domain names to IP addresses. So if you type in a web address in your web browser, DNS will transform the name to a number. In this way, a particular server gets a request transmitted by a user.<br><br>

<strong>Network Load Balancer</strong><br>
Imagine you need to develop a website to scale to serve millions of users, all of whom are accessing it simultaneously. In this case, you need a hardware device called a load balancer that intercepts all the users’ requests and directs them to one of the multiple services. Commonly, servers process users’ requests similarly, so the load balancer spreads the tasks between various services to prevent overloading.<br><br>

<strong>Web App Servers</strong><br>
A web server processes static web content such as HTML pages, images, videos in response to users’ requests and transmits documents back to a web browser. To execute this task, it turns to back-end infrastructures (database, cache server, etc.).<br><br>

<strong>Databases</strong><br>
Databases provide instruments to structure, add, search, upgrade, delete, and run computations. Commonly, web app servers directly communicate with the job servers.<br><br>

<strong>Caching Service</strong><br>
Caching service submits a repository for data, which enables storing and searching information. Anytime users receive data from the server, obtained results come to cache. So, future requests get back quicker. Simply put, caching makes it possible to refer to the previous outcomes to speed up the computation process.<br><br>

<strong>Services</strong><br>
When a web app gets to a specific level, services are made in the form of separate applications. They are not that recognizable among other web app elements, but web applications and other services deal with them.<br><br>

<strong>CDN</strong><br>
Content Delivery System (CDN) controls sending HTML files, CSS files, JavaScript files, and images. It’s a distributed system network that delivers digital content to the end server globally, allowing users to load different sources.<br><br>

<strong>Data Warehouse</strong><br>
All applications deal with data gathering, storing, and analyzing. This process goes through the following stages:<br><br>

    1.The data is delivered to the data “fire station”, which submits a streaming interface for information absorption and processing.<br>
    2.Raw, structured, and unstructured data is transmitted to the cloud storage.<br>
    3.And structured and additional data is also sent to the data warehouse.<br>

The data warehouse is used for keeping an incredible amount of files of different types.<br>

<!--Types of websites-->
<h2 style="font-size:30px ; text-align: center;" >
    <div id="webcontent"><u>
    <strong>
    Types of Websites</u><br></strong>
</h2>

<p>
<strong>E-Commerce Websites<br></strong>
    A website for e-commerce is a website from which individuals can purchase products directly. You’ve likely previously used a number of e-commerce sites; most large brands and many smaller ones have one. Any website with a shopping cart, including a manner to provide data about credit cards for purchases, falls under this category.<br>
    This website is the kind you must create if you are building a website for your enterprises and intend to sell your goods through the website. Some measures must be taken to guarantee that your clients are safe to pay for their eCommerce site, such as investing in eCommerce software and receiving your SSL certificate. Ecommerce websites can be an expansion of a company or something around which you are building a fresh company.<br><br>

<strong>Business Websites</strong><br>
    A website for a company is a website dedicated to a particular company. They should be branded as the company and communicate the goods and/or services that the company provides. Every prospective client you meet will simply suppose that they will find a website if they are looking for your company at Google. And it makes the company less professional or legitimate if they don’t.
    The website for e-commerce is business websites, but it is also possible to have company websites that do not directly sell anything but rather encourage visitors to contact us for further information or to go to a store if they are looking for customers.<br><br>

<strong>Portfolio Websites</strong><br>
    Websites on portfolios are sites that show examples of previous work. A website can be used by service suppliers wishing to demonstrate to prospective customers the quality of their work to obtain some of the finest examples of previous work.<br>
    This sort of website is easier to create than a company website and focuses more on a specific job: gathering job samples. This website has been most commonly employed by creative experts and freelancers based on proven expertise and can be a more effective solution to a business-like website.<br><br>

<strong>Media Websites</strong><br>
    News stories or other reporting are collected on media websites. Some overlap here with entertainment websites, although media websites may include reported material concerning or only for entertainment purposes. Sites such as The Washington Post, Slate, and Inc. are included in this category.<br>
    Media websites usually create cash by way of advertising, subscription models, or a mixture of both. There are many media sites online that are often the media branch of media properties, such as TV stations or newspapers, but some are only online. But there are also media properties.<br><br>

<strong>Nonprofit Website</strong><br>
    Just as companies need websites to be online, so do non-profit companies. Many prospective donors can create donations by using a non-profit web page, and many individuals want to know more about a non-profit and see if they want to assist it.<br>
    In order to show your legitimacy and reach more persons, constructing your company web site is or is considering starting a non-profit. You can use it to promote your organization’s initiatives, encourage supporters to take action and accept donations.<br><br>

<strong>Educational Websites</strong><br>
    In the category of academic websites, websites of academic organizations and those provide online courses to students and the person who wants to study. The main aim of these websites is to provide visitors with educational materials or to provide them with information on a learning institution.<br>
    Some instructional websites have publicity, such as entertainment and media websites. Some offer models of subscription or purchasing education products. And for a current organization, some serve as the internet presence.<br><br>

<strong>Infopreneur Website</strong><br>
    Websites from Infopreneur overlap slightly with websites from businesses and e-commerce but are a single form of online business. Creating and selling data products by infopreneurs. This can be classes, tutorials, videos or ebooks. Infopreneurs need to work hard to build an awareness brand to convince tourists that they understand enough to create their instructional goods worth purchasing and to sell those goods.<br>
    In order to safely sell data goods, some of the same website tools, including an SSL certificate and a commercial account, are required. For those with a wide variety of information products, e-commerce software should also make it simpler to pick and buy those who are concerned. An infopreneur website is a key place for both the free content that is a marketing tool to get individuals on the site and paid products that consider their earnings.<br>

<!--HTTP-->
<h2 style="font-size:30px ; text-align: center;" >
    <div id="http"><u>
    <strong>
    HTTP</u><br></strong>
    </h2>

<P>
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.<br>
Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It provides a standardized way for computers to communicate with each other. HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers respond to these requests.<br>
There are three basic features that make HTTP a simple but powerful protocol:<br><br>
<strong>HTTP is connectionless: </strong><br>The HTTP client, i.e., a browser initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made, the client waits for the response. The server processes the request and sends a response back after which client disconnect the connection. So client and server knows about each other during current request and response only. Further requests are made on new connection like client and server are new to each other.
<br><br><strong>1. HTTP is media independent: </strong><br>It means, any type of data can be sent by HTTP as long as both the client and the server know how to handle the data content. It is required for the client as well as the server to specify the content type using appropriate MIME-type.
<br><br><strong>2. HTTP is stateless: </strong><br>As mentioned above, HTTP is connectionless and it is a direct result of HTTP being a stateless protocol. The server and client are aware of each other only during a current request. Afterwards, both of them forget about each other. Due to this nature of the protocol, neither the client nor the browser can retain information between different requests across the web pages.
<br><br><strong>3. HTTP Request </strong><br>An HTTP client sends an HTTP request to a server in the form of a request message which includes following format:<br>
* A Request-line<br>
* Zero or more header (General|Request|Entity) fields followed by CRLF<br>
* An empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating the end of the header fields<br>
* Optionally a message-body<br><br>
<strong>HTTP Responses </strong><br>After receiving and interpreting a request message, a server responds with an HTTP response message:<br>
* A Status-line<br>
* Zero or more header (General|Response|Entity) fields followed by CRLF<br>
* An empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating the end of the header fields<br>
* Optionally a message-body<br><br>

<!--Dynamic web site-->
<h2 style="font-size:30px ; text-align: center;" >
    <div id="dyn"><u>
    <strong>
    Dynamic Web Page</u><br></strong>
    </h2>

<P>
    A dynamic web page is a web page that displays different content each time it's viewed. For example, the page may change with the time of day, the user that accesses the webpage, or the type of user interaction. 
    <br>There are two types of dynamic web pages.<br><br>
    <strong>CLIENT-SIDE SCRIPTING</strong><br>
    Web pages that change in response to an action within that web page, such as a mouse or a keyboard action, use client-side scripting.
    Client-side scripts generate client-side content. Client-side content is content that's generated on the user's computer rather than the server. In these cases, the user's web browser would download the web page content from the server, process the code that's embedded in the web page, and then display the updated content to the user.
    Scripting languages such as JavaScript and Flash allow a web page to respond to client-side events.<br><br>
    
    <strong>SERVER-SIDE SCRIPTING</strong><br>
    Web pages that change when a web page is loaded or visited use server-side scripting. Server-side content is content that's generated when a web page is loaded. For example, login pages, forums, submission forms, and shopping carts, all use server-side scripting since those web pages change according to what is submitted to it.
    Scripting languages such as PHP, ASP, ASP.NET, JSP, ColdFusion and Perl allow a web page to respond to submission events.<br>

    <strong>
        Application Server</u><br></strong>
    </h2>

<p>
    Applications come in all shapes, sizes, and use cases. In a world where we rely on a host of critical business processes, 
    application servers are the high-powered computers providing application resources to users and web clients.<br>
    Application servers physically or virtually sit between database servers storing application data and web servers communicating with clients. 
    App servers and akin middleware are the operating systems supporting an application’s development and delivery. 
    Whether it’s a desktop, mobile, or web app, application servers play a critical role in connecting a world of devices.<br><br>

    <strong>How Do Application Servers Work? </strong><br>
    Like most servers today, application servers contain features for security, transactions, services, clustering, diagnostics, and databases. 
    Where application servers deviate is their ability to process servlet requests from a web server.<br><br>

    1.The client opens a browser and requests access to a website
    <br>2.The web server receives the HTTP request and responds with the desired webpage
    <br>3.The web server handles static data requests, but the client wants to use an interactive tool
    <br>4.As a dynamic data request, the web server transfers the request to an application server
    <br>5.The application server receives the HTTP request and converts it into a servlet request
    <br>6.The servlet reaches the database server, and the app server receives a servlet response
    <br>7.The app server translates the servlet response into HTTP format for client access
    <br><br>Upon receiving a servlet request from a web server, the application server processes the request and responds to the web server via servlet response. 
    Because application servers primarily work with business logic requests, the web server translates the servlet response and passes an HTTP response accessible to the user.<br><br>

    <strong>
        Web Security</u><br></strong>
    </h2>

<p>
    Web Security is a part of Internet Security that is more and more necessary to grant the web navigation within Companies, Organizations and schools of every type and level, in order to be safe from threats and undesired contents while working.
    An effective cyber security solution requires a set of technologies, procedures and means dedicated to the protection of IT systems.<br>

    <br><strong>What is Web Security?</strong><br>
    The web is an unlimited source of all types of information and resources, that can be used by whomever in a simple and intuitive way. It is therefore extremely important to be aware and informed about what dangers can be present in the Internet world.

    It is estimated that over the coming 2-3 years, almost 100% of all the workload will move to the Cloud, hence web security takes on an even more fundamental role in companies, 
    organizations and schools of all types and levels.<br>

    Web Security deals with the provision of tools, procedures and several useful rules in order to 
    protect yourself and your structure from cyber attacks, loss of data and from access to 
    dangerous or undesired websites.
    Very often people tend to overlook the concept of Internet security, 
    thinking that they are immune or that they are not potential subjects of ransomware or data breaches, 
    but this is not the case since attacks are often carried out even just in order to damage the reputation 
    or slow down the operations of a company, organization or institution.<br>

    The risk is there every day, since even a small interruption or violation of the web security 
    can result in a countless waste of time and data, delays, disruptions with clients and hence 
    a damage in terms of profit and company credibility.<br>

    Over the last years more and more Organizations have been obliged to close down 
    following huge losses of data and/or the payment of enormous ransomware in order not 
    to make public confidential data and information, or because of blackmailing by 
    hackers that has resulted in the paralysis of a company’s activities.<br>
